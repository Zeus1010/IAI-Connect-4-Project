# CIS : 667 IAI-Connect-4-Project

We have implemented Connect 4 game in Python primarily using Minimax algoritm.
***
1. The following [Medium Post](https://medium.com/analytics-vidhya/artificial-intelligence-at-play-connect-four-minimax-algorithm-explained-3b5fc32e4a4f) was referred to while implementing the heuristic function. For Minimax algorithm implementation class code was referred.

2. In order to download the required librabries, after downloading the repository just run the following command : `pip3 install  -r requirements.txt`

3. To run the interactive domain program, for playing game run the follwing command : `python3 play.py`

4. For running experiments, run the following commmand, upon running this command the program will ask you to enter any one of the competition you want to run. Currently there are 2 types of competitions, Tree Based AI vs Baseline AI and Neural Net vs Baseline AI. For the Neural Net only board size of 5x5 works : `python3 compete.py`
